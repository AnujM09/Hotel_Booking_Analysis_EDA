# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_EDA
Hotel bookings depend on many factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week, meals available, parking spaces, charges etc. Hence analysing the patterns available in the past data is very important to help the hotels plan well accordingly in order to benefit the business. The given data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces etc, we tried to understand the customer’s’ behaviour and useful patterns in the data to help hotel managements improve the business by taking better decisions. The sequence of processes carried out to analyse the data is mentioned below:
# EDA:
We performed univariate, Hotel Wise comparison, bivariate, multivariate and correlation analysis by plotting some visualizations and data wrangling to find out useful insights and make overall inferences to reach to a conclusion.

## We encountered following patterns in the given historical data:

-Around 61% bookings are for City hotel and 39% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel. Also the overall adr of City hotel is slightly higher than Resort hotel.

-Most of the guests came from European countries, with most no. of guest coming from Portugal.

-Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO.

-For hotels higher adr deals come via GDS channel, so hotels should increase their popularity on this channel. Almost 30% of bookings via TA/TO are cancelled.

-Not getting same room as reserved, longer lead time and waiting time do not affect cancellation of bookings. Although different room allotment do lowers the adr.

-July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels.     

-Most preferred meal type is BB( Bed and breakfast).      

-Most of the bookings that are cancelled have waiting period of less than 150 days but also most of bookings that are not cancelled also have waiting period of less than 150 days. Hence this shows that waiting period has no effect on cancellation of bookings.
